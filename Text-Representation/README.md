# Text Representation:

**Text Representation** In the context of natural language processing (NLP), a text representation refers to the various ways in which text can be transformed or encoded into a format that can be understood and processed by machine learning models or algorithms. This transformation is necessary because most NLP algorithms require numerical input, while text data is inherently non-numerical.

### Bag of words(BoW) Model:

**[Bag of Words (Bow)](https://github.com/JamorMoussa/learn-NLP/blob/main/Text-Representation/Bag-of-Words-Model.ipynb)** Model is text representation technique that was commnonly used in NLP, specialy in text classification. The key idea is to represent text as collection (Bag) of words while ignoring the order and context.
